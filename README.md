# CASE STUDY FOR BLACKROCK

## Overview and Origin

* Name of company
The company I am choosing for the purposes of this project is Blackrock Inc.

* When was the company incorporated?
The company was founded in 1988 and went public in 1999 (Wikipedia: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BlackRock).

* Who are the founders of the company?
Blackrock was founded in 1988 by Larry Fink, Robert S. Kapito, Barbara Novick, Susan Wagner, Ben Golub, Hugh Frater, Ralph Schlosstein, and Keith Anderson 
(Wikipedia: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BlackRock).

* How did the idea for the company (or project) come about?
Blackrock started off as a risk managment company that sprung from bad experiences by the current CEO Larry Fink.  As head of First Boston Mr. Fink lost $100 Million.  Hence, the company is focused on asset management from a risk management and responsible fiduciary practices (Wikipedia: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BlackRock). Blackrock continues to operate as a risk management first company.
This is an approach that I agree with.  I, myself, believe that taking care of the risk above the profits is the approach everyone should take with respect to investing.  Take care of the downside and the upside will take care of itself eventually.

* How is the company funded? How much funding have they received?
Blackrock has an asset base of 8.67 trillion dollars as of January 2021 (Wikipedia: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BlackRock).  The company is funded with money from other institutions, organizations, and individuals.

## Business Activities:

* What specific financial problem is the company or project trying to solve?
As an asset management company, there are two problems that companies like Blackrock are trying to solve.  One is asset protection and the second is asset growth.
The main focus for companies in this space is to not lose money as the first priority and making money as the second.  Blackrock as stated before, started off in the arena of risk management.  Now their focus is passive management and index funds with risk management underlying all operations (Wikipedia: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BlackRock).

* Who is the company's intended customer?  Is there any information about the market size of this set of customers?
What solution does this company offer that their competitors do not or cannot offer? (What is the unfair advantage they utilize?)
The intended customer for companies like Blackrock are various entities like insurance firms, pension funds, corporations, charities, educational establishments like universities and private investors.  For Blackrock that total size amounts to $8.67 Trillion.
As far as the edge Blackrock has over its competition, that is a little harder to say.  I think it is a question of trust and experience.  The founders and managers appear to
have built a trust with their customers.  In addition, they specialize in index funds which are aggregates of individual stocks and in doing so, they keep the wealth under
their care protected.  However, this is not an edge that their competition does not have.  I liken it to cars.  Some trust Toyota, others Honda, and yet others Ford.  There is
no edge that one has over the other, and that is why all the car brands continue to exist as long as they can maintain that trust.
On the other hand, investing in index funds over time gives better results than actively managed funds due to low costs and the luck factor 
(Source: https://www.thebalance.com/index-funds-vs-actively-managed-funds-2466445).  I liken this to the Who Wants to be a Millionaire Ask the Audience lifeline.
This lifeline in the show has shown a 91 to 92% success rate over the Phone a Friend lifeline at 66%  (http://www.freestak.com/blogposts/who-wants-to-ask-the-audience-the-benefits-and-pitfalls-of-social-media/#:~:text=After%2015%20years%20of%20the,for%20'ask%20the%20audience').  This goes to show that the aggregate of stocks performs better over time.  In the case of index funds firing and forgetting can be the better method because the indexes are an aggregate of businesses.

* Which technologies are they currently using, and how are they implementing them? (This may take a little bit of sleuthing–– you may want to search the company’s engineering blog or use sites like Stackshare to find this information.)
One of the divisions of Blackrock is called Blackrock Solutions.  This division runs analytics and risk management.  The division grew from the Aladdin (Asset, Liability, Debt,
and Derivative Investment Network) system which is run by Blackrock (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aladdin_(BlackRock)), as well as the Green Package (Risk reporting system), PAG (Portfolio Analytics), and AnSer (interactive analytics).  These technologies are proprietary to Blackrock and use risk management to help improve trader performance.  Big
Data and analytics are used to manage portfolios and give clarity and connectivity to the trading process (https://www.blackrock.com/aladdin).
Aladdin uses collective intelligence to meet demand.  Collective intelligence is a tool to help one organize and communicate effectively.  Aladdin is relied upon by thousands of investment professionals around the world and is powered by more than 1000 developers. (https://medium.com/twogap/what-you-may-not-know-the-software-that-is-more-powerful-than-windows-or-even-us-goverment-8f2e08822673).  While the software is very complex and powered by so many developers, much of what we learn in this course can help us understand how such software works at a high level.


## Landscape:

* What domain of the financial industry is the company in?
Blackrock falls under the domain of asset management in the financial industry.  Asset management or investment management refers to the handling of financial assets and other 
investments—not only buying and selling them.  Management includes devising a short- or long-term strategy for acquiring and disposing of portfolio holdings. 
It can also include banking, budgeting, and tax services and duties, as well. (From Investopedia: https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/investment-management.asp).  This is my area of interest as my manage my own assets as well as some assets from my father and uncle.  I specifically focus on the area of investing in assets and less so in the banking and budgeting area.  There are two kinds of investment managers: active and passive.  Active managers just manage assets more frequently than the passive managers.  Passive managers tend toward more buy and hold or set it and forget it type strategies.  I lean more to the latter as I have found it to be more lucrative than actively trading.

* What have been the major trends and innovations of this domain over the last 5-10 years?
Here are some of the trends in the field of investment management (Source: https://blogs.cfainstitute.org/investor/2019/05/15/seven-trends-in-investment-management-ronald-n-kahn/):
1) Increasing leaning to passive versus active investing.  In my own case, I have found longer holding times to be more lucrative.
2) While the trend is moving toward passive investing, the active manager have a lot of competition between them.  This means that more people look at market inefficiencies
that can be exploited and those strategies are traded out of existence.  The more people that know about a strategy, the less the strategy can be exploited.  This is why, I
personally never discuss my strategies in public.
3) Changing Market Environments: As the move to passive index investing happens active traders can compete against the indexes since the major institutions will move to
managing those type of funds. Edges in the market can remain solvent for a longer period of time. 
4) Big Data: this can help all types of investors analyze risk and reward in trades and investing.  As the internet and the related technolgies improve with time, this aspect
of trading will occupy a greater space in the jobs of investment managers along with machine learning.  This class will help us understand this aspect of trading quite well.
5) Smart Beta: this essentially means attempting to get the best of both the passive investing world and the active investing world.  It involves using rules based active
trading and indexing those rules.
6) Investing beyond returns: essentially corporate social responsibility.  This means, for example, investing in alternate energy companies or environmental causes.
7) Fee compression: this is self explanatory.  Fees have come down significantly from the past years.
Blackrock is an index fund specialist and so is already moving in the direction of passive investing.  A look at the website (https://www.blackrock.com/us/individual/2021-blackrock-client-letter)
shows that they are also moving to socially responsible investing.  The fees have also gone down a lot (https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/844779/000119312517084745/d356424d497.htm#:~:text=With%20respect%20to%20Multifactor%20USA,Fund's%20average%20daily%20net%20assets.)
Blackrock is a large firm, however, it is in line with the trends of the investment management field.

* What are the other major companies in this domain?
The following companies are the largest in the asset management space (Source: https://www.thebalance.com/which-firms-have-the-most-assets-under-management-4173923):
1) Blackrock
2) The Vanguard Group
3) UBS Group
4) State Street Global Advisors
5) Fidelity
6) Allianz
7) JP Morgan Chase
8) Bank of New York Mellon
9) Capital Group
10) PIMCO
As of the time of the writing of the source article and Wikipedia, Blackrock was the top company in terms of assets under management.  However, that can change pretty quickly.  There are many hedge funds and mutual funds in this space, but for the sake of space in this report, I only mention the top 10 companies.


## Results

* What has been the business impact of this company so far?
As a manager of 8.67 trillion dollars in assets, the business impact of Blackrock has been enormous.  It has been criticized as the world's largest shadow bank.  In 2020, US
Representatives Katie Porter and Jesus Garcia proposed a bill to Congress to restrain the activities of shadow banks like Blackrock (Wikipedia: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BlackRock).  When the fund and its activities are large enough to catch the attention of the politicians, the impact by the business is very large so to speak.

* What are some of the core metrics that companies in this domain use to measure success? How is your company performing, based on these metrics?
The big metric is assets under management or AUM.  Blackrock remains the highest in this category at $8.67 Trillion as of January 2021.  For comparison Fidelity
has an AUM metric of $4.9 trillion (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fidelity_Investments) and Vanguard has $7.1 trillion under management (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Vanguard_Group).
To be clear and fair, I would normally include figures like the operating income and net income in the performance metrics.  The important metric of consideration is not how much money one takes in, but how much they keep.  Unfortunately, as many of these top investment management firms are private, this information is kept under wraps.  The AUM metric is publically available and using that alone, Blackrock is the best performer.

* How is your company performing relative to competitors in the same domain?
As stated in the answer above, using the publically available information, Blackrock is the best performer in its domain.


## Recommendations

* If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer? (This could be something that a competitor offers, or use your imagination!)
When it comes to trading, I like to look under the hood.  I would like to know more about the software used for their risk management and trading.  Obviously they would have to charge top dollar for this service since more people knowing about the strategy means that it works less and you lose your edge.  As an investment hacker, I personally would be willing to pay the top dollar needed to gain knowledge of this software.


* Why do you think that offering this product or service would benefit the company?
There are pros and cons to offering such an educational service.  One the pro side, those who know the software well can use it for their own trading and data analysis.  They can also make up a pool of potential employees for Blackrock who will need little training.  Charging for the education also adds another stream of income for Blackrock.
On the con side, educating people on using their software and making it accessible would be giving away their edge.  Blackrock would also have to create a department and hire
more employees to help with the dispensation of the software and the education on the topic which would cost some overhead.
As a hacker for investment systems, I favor the pro side, however, Blackrock would have to think about whether they want to educate people on this software and whether there
would be enough customers to make such an endeavor worthwhile.

* What technologies would this additional product or service utilize?
If Blackrock were to teach people about their software, they would need a video service like YouTube for the teaching and of course a downloadable platform for people to practice their programming and trading skills.

* Why are these technologies appropriate for your solution?
YouTube or some other video teaching service would be a good way to spread the teaching and knowledge on the software.  The platform would be their own proprietary technology that they would grant access to after payment.
